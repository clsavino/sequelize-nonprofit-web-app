              <h3>Meals on Wheels</h3>
              <p>The Meals on Wheels program delivers a nutritious meal to frail, elderly and homebound residents of northern Orange County. The only way these meals can be delivered is through the dedication and generosity of the volunteer drivers. Our Meals on Wheels program is very proud to say that not one driver has had to quit or cut down their driving due to the price of gasoline. This shows us that delivering meals is not just a task that must be done, but is an important and delightful part of these drivers’ day.</p>

              <h3>Samaritan Relief Ministry</h3>
              <p>The Samaritan Relief Ministry has seen an increase in people needing help with the basics of life, such as food, shelter, water, electricity and clothing. Much publicity has been given to the national issue of food banks running out of food. At this point, the Samaritan Relief Ministry has not had to turn anyone away because of a lack of food, though sometimes the ministry has had to purchase the basics such as soup, fruit and beans.</p>
              <p>The Samaritan Relief Ministry has continued to see “new” families; people who are new to northern Orange County, or who have never had to seek assistance before. As the price of food continues to be high, and incomes do not increase or jobs become scarce, the need for emergency food assistance is only going to grow. The Samaritan Relief Ministry is only able to distribute what it has in stock.</p>
